#This node is intended to be a simple helper to get things going quickly, 
#but more functionality may be desired to change how the camera works. 
#To make your own custom camera node, inherit it from Node2D and change the 
#transform of the canvas by setting Viewport.canvas_transform in Viewport 
#(you can obtain the current Viewport by using Node.get_viewport()).
